  PizZazz is a small business which was founded in December 2012, by hairstylist
  Madlayn Tinsley. I have been a hairstylist for 20 plus years. I've always had
  a desire to open a Barber Shop on campus to accommodate students and staff
  with affordable prices. I'm very passionate about what I do and I enjoy
  meeting and servicing all nationalities. I have created an environment and
  atmosphere that is welcoming to all people.
