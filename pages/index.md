  I have been a hairstylist for 20 plus years. I've always had a desire to open
  a Barber Shop on campus to accommodate students and staff with affordable
  prices, and in 2012 PizZazz's doors opened.  Here, you will find an
  environment and atmosphere that is welcoming to all people.  I'm very
  passionate about what I do and I enjoy meeting and servicing all
  nationalities.
