stylist1description: I have been a hairstylist for more than 20 years.  I'm very
  passionate about what I do and I enjoy meeting new people.  I've always had a
  desire to open a Barber Shop on campus that could accommodate students and
  staff with affordable prices.  In 2012 PizZazz's doors opened to the public
  and, since then, has been providing an environment and atmosphere that is
  welcoming to people of all nationalities.
