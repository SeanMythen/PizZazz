  I have been a hairstylist for more than 20 years.  I'm very passionate about
  what I do and I enjoy meeting new people.  I've always had a desire to open a
  Barber Shop on campus that could accommodate students and staff with
  affordable prices.  In 2012 PizZazz's doors opened to the public and, since
  then, has been providing an environment and atmosphere that is welcoming to
  people of all nationalities.

  have dedicated 25 years of service to the hair industry. I enjoy doing hair. I
  started with Pizzazz in the fall of 2018. I find Pizzazz to be a place of
  love, life, and an entertaining atmosphere.
