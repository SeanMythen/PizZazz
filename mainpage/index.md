stylist1description: I have been a hairstylist for more than 20 years.  I'm very
  passionate about what I do and I enjoy meeting new people.  I've always had a
  desire to open a Barber Shop on campus that could accommodate students and
  staff with affordable prices.  In 2012 PizZazz doors opened to the public and,
  since then, has been providing an environment and atmosphere that is welcoming
  to people of all nationalities.

stylist2description: I am happy to come on board with Madlayn at PizZazz. I am
  excited to get back to campus where I first started my career. I have been a
  Cosmetologist since 1995. I love doing hair and meeting people from near and
  far.
